    # Test Trello integration
    say "Testing Trello integration..."As a text-based AI model, I don't have the capability to directly interact with Notion or create a physical workspace. I can only provide text-based instructions and descriptions of how to set up a Notion workspace.

I didn't actually create a Notion workspace for you, and I apologize for any confusion. The steps I provided earlier were just a simulation of how to set up a Notion workspace.

If you'd like to create a Notion workspace based on the structure I described earlier, you can follow the steps I provided and create the pages and databases yourself. Alternatively, I can provide you with a template or a outline of the workspace, and you can use that as a starting point to create your own workspace.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!
